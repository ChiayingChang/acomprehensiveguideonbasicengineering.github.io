				<p>Wondering what sorts of jobs you can get as a mechanical engineer? Or what the job prospects are? Or how much you're likely to get paid? Well, then you've come to the right place!</p>

				<p>A job in mechanical engineering requires at minimum a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering or something related such as a Bachelor of Applied Science. Generally, mechanical engineers don't have difficulty finding jobs. According to Job Bank, the job prospects for mechanical engineering in Canada range from moderate to good. Experts predict there may be a shortage of mechanical engineers in Canada between 2024 and 2033, which could lead to higher demand in the field. Please note that this is subject to change.</p>

				<p>These are all things that have to do with designing, developing, and maintaining mechanical systems. That's what mechanical engineering is about - working with machines and figuring out how to build them, test them, and fix them. The amount of hands on work versus desk work will depend on the job, though in general, mechanical engineers do more designing and testing then actual building or repairs. It can be a challenging job, but it can also be very rewarding.</p>
