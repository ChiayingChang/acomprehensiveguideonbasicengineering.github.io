				<p>You might be wondering, what exactly is it that chemical engineers do? Well, that's what we're here to answer. Chemical engineering is a broad field, and there are many things that they do.</p>

				<p>Chemical engineers work with the development of different products that involve the use of chemicals or chemical reactions. They work in numerous fields, such as in drink making, makeup product creation, pharmaceuticals, and more. They are responsible for finding solutions for various challenges while still keeping factors in mind such as cost and safety. They are involved in the whole process, from designing and researching to testing, often working with a range of other professionals to get the job done.</p>

				<p>They work in many different trades, like healthcare or environmental safety. Their main job is to work with chemicals to produce products, which can also include constructing safety procedures, designing equipment, running tests, and researching.</p>

				<p>You may be wondering, what's the difference between a chemist and a chemical engineer? They are similar professions, both involving working with chemicals. However, chemical engineering is a field of expertise centered around the development of products and systems using chemical processes, while chemists study liquids, solids, and gases, learning about their atomic structure and discovering properties. They alter the chemicals and conduct tests on them to learn more about how atoms work. Chemical engineers use their knowledge of chemistry to create products and solutions for problems, while chemists put emphasis on researching and discovering new principles, often working in theoretical analysis. Chemical engineering is about designing new products, while chemistry is about discovering new things.</p>

				<p>In terms of education, the two fields start off similar. Both require university degrees. Chemists require a bachelor's degree in chemistry, though more advanced degrees is advantageous. Mechanical engineers require a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering or something similar, though higher degrees like a master's is beneficial. Chemists study more theoretical and academic things, while chemical engineers study how to utilize chemistry principles to solve solutions and create products. They may also seek to become professional engineers (PEs) through the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam and the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam, managed by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. (NCEES). Do note that requirements will vary in different places.</p>

				<p>As for work environments, both chemists and chemical engineers work in offices or labs, though they sometimes travel to other locations such as at refineries or industrial plants. In addition, chemists make on average between $64,850 to $80,788 per year, while chemical engineers make an average of $79,006 per year. Please note that salaries vary greatly between sources and may not be entirely accurate.</p>
