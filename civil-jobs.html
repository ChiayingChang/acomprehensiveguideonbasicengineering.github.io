				<p>Wondering what sorts of jobs you can get as a civil engineer? Or what the job prospects are? Or how much you're likely to get paid? Well then you've come to the right place!</p>

				<p>A job in civil engineering requires at minimum a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering or something related such as a Bachelor of Applied Science. Generally, civil engineers don't have difficulty finding jobs. According to Job Bank, the job prospects for civil engineering in Canada range from moderate to good. Experts predict there may be a shortage of mechanical engineers in Canada between 2024 and 2033, which could lead to higher demand in the field. Please note that this is subject to change.</p>

				<p>Depending on the job, there are a variety of different locations that you may be working on, such as at a desk, on field locations, or at construction sites. In the office, civil engineers spend a large portion of their time on computers and work with other professionals such as architects to complete their projects. On field locations, they check the environment around them for safety and complete things like quality checks and and inspections. And on the construction site, they make sure that everything is being carried out safely according to plan and deal with problems as they come up.</p>
