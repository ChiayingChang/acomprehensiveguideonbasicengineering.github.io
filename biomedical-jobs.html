				<p>These are all things that combine medical sciences with engineering, because that's what biomedical engineering is about; using engineering knowledge to create medical devices to address healthcare problems. Biomedical engineers work in places like offices, clinics, and labs. In offices, they often are analyzing data and designing different products. In a clinic, they may work together with other healthcare professionals. And in labs, they experiment with different things and test designs of different prototypes. They may even work in manufacturing settings, where they provide expertise in quality control, production, and hygiene standards.</p>
