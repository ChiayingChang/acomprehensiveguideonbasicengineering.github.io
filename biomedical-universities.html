				<p>University is an essential part to becoming an engineer. While it is possible to become one without having a degree, it'll be much more challenging to find a job and to make a name for yourself in the industry. There are a vast number of universities that offer degrees for engineering, but here, we'll be focusing on three: the University of British Columbia (UBC), the University of Waterloo (U of Waterloo), and the University of Toronto (U of T). This information will mainly cater to those who live in BC, Canada, and will be talking about the undergrad programs for engineering. You will graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Sciences in the type of engineering you choose to study, which will take approximately four years. Click below on each one to find out detailed information, such as the application process, fees, and more! Please note that requirements, fees, and more may change, so check the official websites for up-to-date information.</p>

								<h3>Location</h3>
								<p>UBC's campuses are located in Vancouver and the Okanagan.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Degree</h3>
								<p>A Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Biomedical Engineering.</p>
								<br>

								<h3>Foundations Year</h3>
								<p>All first-year UBC Engineering students take a common set of courses covering fundamental subjects like math, physics, chemistry, and communication. This introductory year is designed to provide a broad understanding of engineering principles while helping students explore different disciplines before choosing their specialization. Once that is completed, students must choose a type of engineering to focus on for their undergraduate degree. In addition, students may choose to work towards a dual or a minor degree. The options for the minor degree are Commerce, Entrepreneurship, Science, and Honours Math. For the dual degree, students enter the Dual Degree in Arts and Engineering Program, where they simultaneously work towards a Bachelor of Applied Science and a Bachelor of Arts. However, it is best to verify that the information for the minors and dual degree is up to date and accurate on the official websites.</p>


								<br>

								<h3>Application Process</h3>
								<p>Students applying to UBC must submit their applications between October and mid-January for the following academic year. First-round offers of admission, awards, and scholarships require an early application. Transcripts and other documents must be submitted after the application; final grades for courses currently being taken are not required.</p>

								<p>In the application, students must answer multiple questions about themselves, including what they want to study and which campus they wish to study on. For engineering, prospective students are advised to select the Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering in Vancouver for one choice, and the same degree in Okanagan for the second choice. In addition, students must submit a personal profile consisting of short essay answers, have two references, and pay a non-refundable application fee of $74.25 for Canadian citizens and permanent residents, and a fee of $170 for international students requiring a study permit. After the application is submitted, they recieve an email from UBC with instructions on submitting documents, which may include high school transcripts, International Baccalaureate results, AP exam results, proof of English language competetency, and post-secondary transcripts. For more information concerning the application process, click <a href="https://engineering.ubc.ca/admissions/undergraduate/how-to-apply">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>What Comes After the Foundation Year?</h3>

								<p>After the first year is complete, students must submit an online Program Preference form. More information can be found on the <a href="https://academicservices.engineering.ubc.ca/degree-planning/program-placement/?_gl=1*14mt0b*_gcl_au*njk5nja2mtc5lje3mze1ntyznzq.*_ga*mtyynjqyntg5nc4xnzmxntu2mzc0*_ga_4hee092k89*mtczmtcxode5mi43ljeumtczmtcxodiwni40ni4wlja.">UBC website</a>.</p>

								<p>For those who wish to pursue biomedical engineering, apply for the Biomedical Engineering program.</p>

								<p>The admissions for UBC's biomedical engineering program is very competitive. They admit based on academic merit and contributions to the community. They look at not only grades, but at hobbies, interests, passions, unique life experiences, and more. The admission process is broad based, meaning students submit a personal profile answering questions revolving around topics such as engagement in the community or leadership. These profiles are then read by people who assess them according to substance, voice, leadership, and engagement. Keep in mind that there is a minimum GPA, which changes each year.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Pre-Biomedical Engineering First Year (PBME)</h3>
								<p>Those that are accepted into the Biomedical Engineering program must take courses over the summer after their first year at UBC, since they are prerequisites for the second year. In addition, they must take an online introductory course. However, this can be replaced by the Pre-Biomedical Engineering First Year program (PBME). This is an alternative option for the foundational year of UBC's Bachelor of Applied Sciences program, preparing students for biomedical engineering. The program allows them to get familarized with the concept of engineering in a medical context and complete the prerequisites for the second year. If students are interested, after being accepted to the first year engineering program, they must complete a supplementary form. This includes answering questions and doing a video interview. For more information, including how the timetables differ between the regular BASc program and the PBME program, click <a href="https://engineering.ubc.ca/programs/undergraduate-programs/biomedical-engineering/pre-biomedical-engineering-first-year">here</a>. As always, double check the official websites to confirm the information.</p>

								<h3>Mechanical and Electrical Engineering</h3>
								<p>The Mechanical and Electrical Engineering programs both offer biomedical engineering options. In the Mechanical Engineering program, students can opt to substitute three courses from the general third and fourth year classes with four biomedical engineering focused courses. In the Electrical Engineering program, students can enter a three year program starting their second year in the BASc program, where they learn about electrical engineering in a biomedical context. No prior knowledge in anything related to biology is required for either of these options. For more information, click <a href="https://engineering.ubc.ca/programs/undergraduate-programs/biomedical-engineering/biomedical-engineering-options">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Capstone Project</h3>
								<p>In their final year, engineering students participate in the Capstone Design Project, a graduation requirement where they collaborate in small teams to address real-world engineering challenges. Under the guidance of faculty mentors, students develop solutions for industry-sponsored projects, building prototypes or models to test their designs. To see examples of past projects, click <a href="https://bme.ubc.ca/education/current-undergraduate-students/capstone/capstone-industry-projects/capstone-innovations-day-2024/">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>Location</h3>
								<p>The University of Waterloo is located in Waterloo, Ontario.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Degree</h3>
								<p>A Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Biomedical Engineering.</p>
								<br>

								<h3>Courses</h3>
								<p>First-year students complete foundational courses in mathematics and engineering principles. In later years, the curriculum shifts toward specialized topics in biomedical engineering. In addition, students graduate with two years of career related experience if they opt to participate in Waterloo's co-op program. Unlike some universities, Waterloo does not offer a general first-year engineering program, and from the first day, coursework is focused on the chosen engineering discipline. Students must choose wisely, because switching between different programs is difficult.To view all the courses required for the undergrad degree, click <a href="https://academic-calendar-archive.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate-studies/2022-2023/page/ENG-Biomedical-Engineering.html">here</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/programs/B1ligZqRn">here</a>. To view all courses in Biomedical Engineering, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/search?q=biomedical&&limit=20&skip=0">here</a>.</p>

								<p>In addition, students are able to enchance their degree and learn more. For more information, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/biomedical-engineering/undergraduate-students/degree-planning-and-enhancement">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Co-op Program</h3>
								<p>Did you know? Waterloo operates one of the largest co-op programs in North America, providing students with hands-on work experience alongside their studies. It's a great way to experience different jobs and the interview process, as well as make money and gain up to two years of experience.</p>

								<p>In the first year, students alternate in four month intervals between work and school, with the choice of staying with one employer or working with different ones to broaden their horizon. They are not limited to working in Canada - they can work internationally too! Each term is four months, with four-six working terms. This is a great way to gain real world experience and to help pay university fees. Please note that students must apply for jobs themselves and interview for positions. To learn more about the program and the schedule, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/co-op-experience">here</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/co-op">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Capstone</h3>
								<p>In their final year, students use their knowledge obtained in class to solve real-world engineering problems. They design projects in an area of interest. There are competitions where students can pitch their ideas to win funding for them, often leading to actual products created with the help of various industries and organizations. For some abstracts of past projects, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/project-abstracts">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>High School Requirements</h3>

								<h2>Grade 12</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><p>Pre-Calc</p></li>
									<li><p>Chemistry</p></li>
									<li><p>English Studies or an equivalent</p></li>
									<li><p>Physics</p></li>
									<li><p>Either Calc or AP Calc</p></li>
									<li><p>At least six grade 12 courses</p></li>
									<li><p>*Note: ADST (Applied Designs, SKills, and Technology) do not count except for Financial Accounting 12 and Economics 12</p></li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<p>Students must upload their midterms marks for their second semester in gr. 12 as soon as possible, because while BC will send marks over, they won't make it in time for admissions.</p>

								<p>Admission to the program is competitive. Please note that the university prefers students not to take summer courses, as it does not demonstrate time magagement. However, online classes are acceptable because balancing regular classes with online classes shows excellent time management.</p>

								<p>It is important to note that if any of the required high school courses were retaken, prospective students must list when it was retaken and why. 5% may be taken off of admissions averages as a penalty. If students passed the course when initially taking it, the university will use that mark without the penalty. However, this may be subject to change.</p>

								<p>If a required course was taken more than two-three years ago, it may be too old to include in applications and students will have to email the Admission Officer team at engineering.admission@uwaterloo.ca to see if the course needs to be retaken.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Application Process</h3>
								<p>After checking the admission requirements for the program, students can look over the <a href="https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergrad-guide/">Undergraduate Application Guide</a> for more information before creating an account and submitting their application to the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) website. Students should check off the co-op option on the page if they're interested in it. For the application deadlines, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/deadlines">here</a>. Within two weeks, students will recieve an email containing the next steps of the application process, along with a student number. For those uncertain about the process, the university offers videos detailing how to apply, which can be found <a href="https://www.ouac.on.ca/videos/how-to-videos/">here</a>. If students are interested, they can apply to two more programs in addition to their Engineering program. However, if they're only interested in applying for one program, they can indicate an alternate Engineering program on their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/admission-information-form">Admission Information Form</a>.</p>

								<p>Some programs have admission requirements other than high school courses, like an Admission Information Form, a portfolio, or an online interview. With the exception of  Architecture, all Engineering programs require an Admission Information Form. Since there are so many students with applications that are similar to each other, this form allows students showcase their unique capabilities and why they should be accepted. In addition, students with extracurriculars are more likely to be successful in the program.</p>

								<p>If there are any special circumstances that may have affected a student's ability to perform well in school, they can go through the requirements for special consideration <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/applicants/special-consideration">here</a> to see if they are eligible for accomodations during the application process.</p>

								<p>For information about the application process, check out the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-students/applying/admissions-frequently-asked-questions#requirements">FAQ page</a>.</p>

								<h3>Location</h3>
								<p>The University of Toronto is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Degree</h3>
								<p>Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Biomedical Engineering.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Courses</h3>
								<p>The program for the Bachelor of Applied Science is four years long. Students begin with foundational engineering concepts in their first two years. In their third and fourth year, they narrow their focus, with more freedom to choose their own courses. In addition, they can complete an optional Professional Experience Year co-op program after the third year of the program. In their fourth year, students complete a Capstone Design Program and present their work at the end of the year.</p>

								<p>For a full list of Biomedical Engineering courses, click <a href="https://bme.utoronto.ca/current-students/course-calendar/">here</a>.</p>

								<br>

								<h3>Capstone Project</h3>
								<p>You might be wondering, what is the capstone project? Capstone Design is a mandatory project completed during the fall and winter sessions of the fourth year of study, where students collaborate with clients to design engineering solutions for their real-world issues. The project is open ended and welcomes creativity, allowing students to apply their problem-solving skills. The project may be standard, student-sourced, multidisplinary, or intenational. Students must apply their engineering knowledge and skills, demonstrate teamwork, judgement, and client interaction, and show the ability to manage projects. In the end, they must come up with a demonstration of the design and complete a reflection. For examples of past projects, click <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/project-abstracts/2025-capstone-design-projects/2025-biomedical-engineering-capstone-designs">here</a>.</p>
