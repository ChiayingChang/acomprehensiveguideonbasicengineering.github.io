				<p>You might be wondering, what exactly is it that electrical engineers do? Well, that's what we're here to answer.</p>

				<p>Electrical engineers work with electrical systems, products, and devices, designing, building, and maintaining them. They do things such as testing the devices or systems, evaluating them, repairing them, and giving recommendations. They often work with other types of engineers such as software engineers or mechanical engineers, or other professionals, to ensure their project goes safely and smoothly.</p>

				<p>There are fields within electrical engineering that you can specialize in, such as signal processing, power systems, or electronics.</p>

				<p>Some electrical engineering jobs may require coding knowledge, and things like electronic engineering often requires the use of languages such as Python or C. In addition, things like hardware design and circuit troubleshooting will often require coding and electrical engineering skills. In fact, it isn't uncommon for electrical engineers to switch to software engineering. However, if you are unwilling to learn coding skills, there are fields such as power systems or analog electronics where coding isn't a necessary skill.</p>

				<p>You may be wondering, what's the difference between an electrician and an electrical engineer? They are similar professions, both involving working with electrical devices. However, electrical engineers deal with the theoretical side of it, while electricians are more hands on. In essence, electrical engineers design and test electrical products. They analyze, develop, and plan, in addition to troubleshooting and supervising installation and manufacturing. They build prototypes and optomize designs. Electricians inspect, repair, and build. They install electrical appliances and ensure things are safe for use. They maintain things and work with their hands, and they're the ones to go to if you want something fixed or maintained. Electrical engineers have more theoretical knowledge, while electricians have more practical knowledge.</p>

				<p>In terms of education, becoming an electrician requires high school graduation, with additional training in a technical school or in an apprenticeship program. Then they must aquire a license to become an electrician, usually through an exam. Electrical engineers require a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or something similar, though higher degrees like a master's is beneficial. They may also seek to become professional engineers (PEs) through the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam and the Principles and Practice of Engineeering (PE) exam, managed by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. (NCEES). Do note that requirements will vary in different places.</p>

				<p>As for work environments, electricians often travel for work, visiting different places to work on the electrical systems there. Electrical engineers usually work in office settings or test their prototypes in labs, though they may travel to different locations for their work. In addition, electricians make an average of $64,281 to $74,653 per year, while elecrical engineers make an average of $94,491 per year. Please note that salaries vary greatly between sources and may not be entirely accurate.</p>
