				<p>You might be wondering, what exactly is it that biomedical engineers do? Well, that's what we're here to answer. Biomedical engineering is a broad field, and there are many things that they do.</p>

				<p>BIomedical engineers use engineering knowledge to solve problems in the healthcare field. They combine things like medical knowledge, design, and engineering to create devices that help people with health issues. They often work together with other professionals in the medical field such as physiotherapists, doctors, and scientists.</p>

				<p>They do things like design prosthetics, equipment, drug delivery systems, and more. They test their products to ensure that they are safe to use, efficient, and cost effective. They maintain and repair equipment, and often train others in using medical devices.</p>

				<p>You may be wondering, what's the difference between biomedical science and biomedical engineering? They are similar professions, both in the medical field. However, biomedical scientists deal more with research, while biomedical engineers deal more with creating. In essence, biomedical engineers design and test medical devices. They analyze, develop, and plan, in addition to troubleshooting and supervising installation. They build prototypes and optomize designs. Biomedical scientists research diseases and formulate treatments, learning new things about the human body.</p>

				<p>In terms of education, both require university degrees. Biomedical engineers require a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering or something similar, though higher degrees like a master's is beneficial. They may also seek to become professional engineers (PEs) through the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam and the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam, managed by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. (NCEES). Biomedical scientists require a bachelor's degree in a biomedical science, though a higher degree is beneficial. In addition, some pursue medical degrees. Do note that requirements will vary in different places.</p>

				<p>As for work environments, biomedical scientsists work in a large variety of areas, such as in medical schools, labs, or hospitals. Biomedical engineers usually work in an office or a lab, though they often travel to locations such as hospitals or clinics. In addition, biomedical scientists make an average of $100,182 per year, while biomedical engineers make an average of $70,866 to $118,045 per year. Please note that salaries vary greatly between sources and may not be entirely accurate.</p>
