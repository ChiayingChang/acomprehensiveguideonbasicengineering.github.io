				<p>You might be wondering, what exactly is it that civil engineers do? Well, that's what we're here to answer.</p>

				<p>Civil engineers are responsible for designing, building, maintaining, and repairing infrastructure. Their role involves ensuring that their designs are safe, sustainable, practical, and affordable. They plan and manage the construction of various structures. These include but are not limited to buildings, bridges, an airports. Additionally, their work includes supervising construction, conducting site investigations, documenting projects, and managing budgets.</p>

				<p>Basically, civil engineers work on structures such as buildings, dams, and bridges, and need to know how to do it safely and with quality. Becoming one requires strong knowledge about things like material sciences, structural mechanics, and geotechnology. In addition, civil engineers often work closely with others such as architects, contractors, clients, and even people from the government, which means that they need to be able to communicate well.</p>

				<p>You may be wondering, what's the difference between a construction worker and a civil engineer? They are similar professions, both involving working on buildings and infrastructure. However, civil engineers deal with the theoretical side of it, while construction workers are more hands on. In essence, civil engineers design and supervise the building of structures. They analyze, develop, and plan. Construction workers do the actual building. Civil enginers have the theoretical knowledge, while construction workers have the practical knowledge.</p>

				<p>In terms of education, high school graduation is recommended although sometimes not a requirement for becoming a construction worker. It's also a good idea to get technical training, though in some cases in may not be a prerequisite. Physical fitness is also necessary for construction work. Civil engineers require a bachelor's degree in civil engineering or something similar, though higher degrees like a master's is beneficial. They may also seek to become professional engineers (PEs) through the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam and the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam, managed by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. (NCEES). Do note that requirements will vary in different places.</p>

				<p>As for work environments, construction workers spend their time on construction sites. Civil engineers sometimes work in the office, and sometimes work on the construction site, directing workers to carry out their plans and ensuring everything is done safely. In addition, construction workers make an average of $58,127 per year, while civil engineers make an average of $92,231. Please note that salaries vary greatly between sources and may not be entirely accurate.</p>
